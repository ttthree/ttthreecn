Samsung S25 Ultra Goes All Out! In terms of appearance design, according to the exposed concept images, the front of this Samsung S25 Ultra adopts a highly futuristic full-screen design with an ultra-visual poreless screen. The ultra-visual poreless screen means that due to the use of Samsung's self-developed poreless under-screen front camera technology, the front of the phone is very pure. At the same time, the ultra-visual borderless micro-curved screen packaging process, coupled with an extremely narrow forehead and chin, makes the entire front of the phone look very shocking. Moreover, the front of this Samsung S25 Ultra features a 6.86-inch new-generation Samsung AMOLED screen with a screen resolution of 3120*1440 and a peak brightness of up to 4000 nits. At the same time, this screen is also equipped with a new-generation LTPO technology. Therefore, the display effect and screen experience of this phone will be more outstanding.

In terms of the camera, this Samsung S25 Ultra adopts a rear quad-camera design. The rear quad-camera is arranged in the upper left corner of the back of the phone. And to enhance the technological sense of the phone, a 3.1-inch multifunctional secondary screen is integrated on the other side of the camera. The addition of the multifunctional secondary screen not only brings more gameplay to the phone but also enhances the differentiation of the phone. In terms of the parameters of the camera, it is reported that this phone adopts a new-generation 200-megapixel super-large bottom main camera + 50-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens + 50-megapixel super-periscope telephoto + 12-megapixel telephoto rear super quad-camera imaging system. If this is the case, the addition of the 200-megapixel new-generation rear quad-camera super imaging system, coupled with Samsung's imaging algorithm, then the camera performance and camera experience of this phone will be taken to a higher level.
